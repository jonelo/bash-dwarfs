# bash-dwarfs
bash-dwarfs is a collection of tiny bash scripts (as known as a dwarf) that can do some work for you. The term has nothing to do with bashing a drarf since bash stands for "Bourne-again shell" - one of the most famous shells for GNU/Linux and Unix systems. No dwarf was harmed in the making of this collection of scripts ;-)
